# Results and Analysis

There were over 2.3 million Citi Bike Rides and over 1.5 million of them were male.

Along with having more male than female customers, we also found that many riders are using Citi Bike for their commute to work, based on the time of day they are riding.

We believe Citi Bike should invest in a marketing campaign geared for women, showing how easy it is to take Citi Bike for their own work commutes, errands, social events, etc
We would also like to convert more female customers from 'Customer' to 'Subscriber'

# Conclusion
In conclusion, one factor that we did not have any data on was weather. I would recommend collecting data on weather, and seeing how that factors into the number of trips, the length of trips, and other breakdowns.
